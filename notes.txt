golden:
beautiful frontend report
- grab ecrs from an s3 bucket
structures + dispay reconstructed entire document (all chunks)
 - underlying thing is the reconstructed json
 - citation links back to original xml documents
 - demonstrate llm inference on xml text segment
  - ex: pregnancy, travel histpry, occupation (make up data if need be) ask llm for value (haiku 3.5 on every open ended text field for the questions too)
    - is patient pregnant
    - does patient have recent travel history (yes/no, where, when)
    - does patient have occupation
  - update underlying json (pregnant: true (gotten from llm inference) (citable))
  - throw in snomed/loinc if applicable
- show that any provider sample can be tested with (test with nevada and florida)
