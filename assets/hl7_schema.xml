This allows for cases where a patient cannot remember exact dates of travel (e.g. I traveled to London, Paris, and Berlin in July and August 2016). However, most uses will involve a single component (location), Free text describing the travel history details and location can be entered using the Observation.component.valueCodeableConcept.text element, Use component.codeableConcept to record a coded location, Use component.extension to record a specific address</text>
