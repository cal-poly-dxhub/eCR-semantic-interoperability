### Technical Terms

**chunk**
: A section of an XML document, typically enclosed within `<text>...</text>` and/or `<table>...</table>` tags.

**path**
: A string representing the navigation route to parse an XML document and locate a specific chunk or value.

**similarity score**
: A floating-point number that quantifies how closely two chunks resemble each other.

**additive score**
: A cumulative score calculated by summing the similarity scores of each category across all chunks. This helps identify the category that is most similar overall to the current chunk by comparing each additive score for each category.

**best match**
: A chunk that achieved the highest similarity score when compared against all other existing chunks in the database.

**category**
: A predefined classification or grouping defined in your schema that is used to organize and label chunks of text based on their content or purpose within the document.

**schema**
: A JSON schema file adhering to https://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema that defines a set of properties, each with its own description. For example: `assets/hl7_schema.json`.

**guardrail**
: A set of rules or constraints implemented to ensure the proper functionality, safety, and security of the system and data when using AI models.

**pipeline**
: The end-to-end process by which an embeddings file is added to the dataset or a new file is tested against the existing dataset.

**prompt**
: The input text given to the model to guide its response. It can include questions, commands, or context (data) that shapes how the model generates its output.

**dataset**
: The collection of chunks, labeled with their respective files and containing their embeddings, original text, and predefined category.

**embedding**
: A vector representation of the text in a given chunk, typically generated using machine learning models to capture semantic meaning.
