Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, and dark urine reported. Genitourinary: No complaints. Musculoskeletal: No complaints. Neurological: No complaints. Psychiatric: No complaints. Endocrine: No complaints. Hematologic: No complaints. Allergies: No known drug allergies.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Jackson is a 33-year-old Black, non-Hispanic female who presents with a 3-week history of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, jaundice, and dark urine. Symptoms started gradually around April 25th with fatigue, which progressively worsened. Abdominal discomfort began about 10 days ago, described as a dull, aching pain in the right upper quadrant. Nausea and loss of appetite followed shortly after. She noticed yellowing of her eyes and skin about 5 days ago, along with dark urine. She denies fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. She has no known exposure to hepatitis but did have a recent vacation in New York City in mid-April. She is sexually active with one male partner and uses barrier protection. She denies high-risk sexual behavior, IV drug use, or occupational exposure to blood or body fluids. Family denies any history of liver disease.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the history and physical exam findings, the leading diagnosis is acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The following steps will be taken: 1) Order HCV RNA quantitative test to confirm diagnosis and determine viral load. 2) Obtain baseline labs including CBC, CMP, PT/INR, HBsAg, HIV, and HAV IgM to evaluate disease severity and rule out other causes. 3) Perform abdominal ultrasound to assess liver status. 4) Consult gastroenterology for evaluation and initiation of direct-acting antiviral therapy, likely a pangenotypic regimen such as glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. 5) Provide counseling on avoiding alcohol, practicing safe sex, and preventing transmission. 6) Schedule follow-up in 2 weeks to monitor treatment response and side effects. The goal is to achieve a sustained virologic response and complete cure.",
