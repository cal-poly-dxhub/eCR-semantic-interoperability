Prior to that, patient visited family in Ponce (April 12-14, 2024), including attendance at a gathering in a public park and dining at a crowded restaurant. In early March (March 5-8, 2024), patient traveled by air to Miami, Florida for a business meeting, staying at a hotel and participating in group discussions in conference rooms. These travel events, particularly the recent conference in San Juan with its indoor setting and multiple contacts, may have increased patient's risk of COVID-19 exposure."

She was diagnosed with hypertension 2 years ago and is on lisinopril 10mg daily. Patient is a former smoker, having quit 5 years ago after a 10-pack-year history. She has no history of diabetes, heart disease, or other chronic conditions. Patient had chickenpox as a child and reports being up-to-date on routine vaccinations.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Positive for fatigue and fever. Respiratory: Positive for cough and shortness of breath. Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain or palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Negative for nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Musculoskeletal: Positive for mild body aches. Neurological: Positive for mild headache. ENT: Positive for sore throat. Skin: Negative for rashes. Psychiatric: Negative for anxiety or depression. All other systems reviewed and negative.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Carmen Rivera, a 42-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening respiratory symptoms. She reports the onset of a dry cough and low-grade fever on 2024-06-06, which she initially attributed to her asthma or a common cold. However, her symptoms progressively worsened, with the development of shortness of breath, particularly notable when climbing stairs or performing routine household activities. Her fever has persisted, ranging from 38.5\u00b0C to 39\u00b0C, only partially responsive to over-the-counter antipyretics. She also complains of fatigue, mild body aches, and a sore throat. Ms. Rivera recently attended a marketing conference in San Juan from May 20-24, where she was in close contact with numerous colleagues in indoor settings. She denies any known direct exposure to COVID-19 positive individuals but acknowledges the possibility given her recent travel and work in the tourism industry. She has been working from home since the onset of symptoms and has self-isolated from her family members. Ms. Rivera has not received a COVID-19 test prior to this visit.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient to isolation room for management of moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. 2. Initiate supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 94%. 3. Start remdesivir 200 mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV daily for 4 days. 4. Administer dexamethasone 6 mg IV daily for up to 10 days. 5. Continue patient's home medications, including lisinopril for hypertension. 6. Provide albuterol inhaler as needed for breakthrough wheezing. 7. Encourage prone positioning when awake to improve oxygenation. 8. Monitor vital signs, including continuous pulse oximetry. 9. Obtain daily CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer). 10. Repeat chest X-ray in 48-72 hours to assess progression. 11. Initiate DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily. 12. Provide supportive care including IV fluids, antipyretics, and nutritional support as needed. 13. Consult respiratory therapy for chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry. 14. Monitor for clinical deterioration and escalate care if needed. 15. Provide patient education on COVID-19 and importance of isolation. 16. Plan for discharge when clinically stable with adequate oxygenation on room air, with follow-up in 1-2 weeks.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient reports receiving two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in early 2021, but has not received any booster doses. Unable to provide exact dates of vaccination. Patient expresses uncertainty about the need for boosters and admits to not keeping up with current recommendations."

She was discharged home on June 12, 2024, with a fair prognosis and expected recovery."
