Patient developed cirrhosis at age 28 and was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 6 months ago. History of failed antiviral therapy for hepatitis B. No history of alcohol abuse. Family history significant for hepatitis B in mother. Previous treatments for HCC include radiofrequency ablation of a 3 cm lesion in right lobe 4 months ago. Patient has been on sorafenib for the past 3 months with limited response. No other significant medical conditions.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Reports significant fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 10 lbs in the past month, and low-grade fever. Denies chills or night sweats.\nSkin: Notes yellowish discoloration of skin and eyes.\nHEENT: Denies headaches, vision changes, hearing problems, or sore throat.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain or palpitations. Reports mild shortness of breath with exertion.\nRespiratory: Denies cough or wheezing.\nGastrointestinal: Severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain, worse with deep breathing. Reports nausea, decreased appetite, and early satiety. Denies vomiting or changes in bowel habits.\nGenitourinary: Denies dysuria or hematuria.

        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Larson is a 32-year-old female with a history of chronic hepatitis B and recently diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma who presents with worsening right upper quadrant abdominal pain and increasing fatigue over the past week. She was diagnosed with HCC 6 months ago and underwent radiofrequency ablation of a 3 cm lesion in the right lobe of her liver 4 months ago. She has been on sorafenib for the past 3 months with limited response.\n\nThe patient reports that her abdominal pain has become severe and constant, rated 8/10, and is worse with deep breathing. She has also noticed increasing abdominal distension over the past few days. Additionally, she reports worsening fatigue, decreased appetite, and unintentional weight loss of about 10 lbs in the last month. She has been experiencing intermittent low-grade fevers and has noticed yellowing of her skin and eyes over the past 48 hours.\n\nShe denies any recent travel or sick contacts. She has not started any new medications and denies use of alcohol or illicit substances. She has been compliant with her sorafenib regimen but feels it has not been helping. Her last follow-up imaging 1 month ago showed stable disease, but she was due for repeat imaging this week.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient to oncology service for further evaluation and management of worsening symptoms related to hepatocellular carcinoma and underlying chronic hepatitis B.\n\n2. Obtain urgent CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast to assess for progression of HCC and to evaluate for potential complications such as tumor rupture or portal vein thrombosis.\n\n3. Laboratory studies including CBC, CMP, PT/INR, AFP, and hepatitis B viral load.\n\n4. Paracentesis for symptomatic relief of ascites and diagnostic purposes.\n\n5. Pain management with opioid analgesics, titrated as needed.\n\n6. Initiate IV hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances as needed.\n\n7. Consult hepatology for management of chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis.\n\n8. Consult interventional radiology to discuss potential for TACE (transarterial chemoembolization) or other loco-regional therapies depending on imaging results.\n\n9. Discuss case at multidisciplinary tumor board to determine best course of action given disease progression on sorafenib.\n\n10. Consider second-line systemic therapy options such as regorafenib or immunotherapy.\n\n11. Palliative care consultation for symptom management and discussion of goals of care given poor prognosis.\n\n12. Nutritional consultation for management of cachexia and optimization of nutritional status.\n\n13. Physical therapy and occupational therapy evaluations for deconditioning.\n\n14. Social work consultation for psychosocial support and resource management.\n\n15. Close monitoring of liver function and coagulation status.\n\n16.

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 32-year-old female with chronic hepatitis B since age 18 developed cirrhosis at 28 and was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 6 months ago. She underwent radiofrequency ablation 4 months ago and has been on sorafenib for 3 months with limited response. She was admitted with severe abdominal pain, fatigue, and jaundice. CT scan showed disease progression. The patient has a poor prognosis and requires aggressive treatment, including consideration of TACE and second-line therapy with regorafenib."
