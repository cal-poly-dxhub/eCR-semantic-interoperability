A 27-year-old Native American male presented with fever, headache, and meningitis symptoms after swimming at Pyramid Lake. He rapidly deteriorated with altered mental status and seizures. Salmonella meningitis was diagnosed based on blood and CSF cultures. He was admitted to the ICU for IV antibiotics, seizure management, and supportive care, with a guarded prognosis due to the severity of his neurological complications."
