These recent food-related activities, particularly the seafood restaurant in Boston and the community potluck in Portland, could be potential sources of Salmonella infection and should be considered in the context of her current condition."

She has no history of gastrointestinal disorders, food allergies, or chronic illnesses. She had a tonsillectomy at age 8 and appendectomy at age 18, both without complications. No history of hospitalizations for infectious diseases or foodborne illnesses.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Reports fatigue and low-grade fever. Denies chills or night sweats.\nGastrointestinal: Complains of severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and nausea. Denies vomiting, blood in stool, or mucus in stool.\nGenitourinary: Denies dysuria or increased urinary frequency.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain or palpitations.\nRespiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing.\nNeurological: Reports mild headache. Denies dizziness or confusion.\nMusculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or muscle aches.\nSkin: Denies rashes or unusual skin changes.\nPsychiatric: Denies anxiety or depression related to current illness.\nEndocrine: Denies excessive thirst or changes in appetite.\nHematologic: Denies easy bruising or bleeding.\nAllergic/Immunologic: Denies any known allergies or recent immunosuppression.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Moreau, a 26-year-old white non-Hispanic female, presents with a 3-day history of severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Symptoms began abruptly on July 6, 2024, approximately 3 days after returning from a business trip to Boston. She reports having 6-8 watery, non-bloody stools per day. Abdominal cramps are described as intermittent and moderately severe, mostly in the lower abdomen. On July 7, she developed a low-grade fever and nausea but denies vomiting. She also reports feeling fatigued and having a mild headache since July 8. The patient has been trying to stay hydrated but is concerned about signs of mild dehydration. She denies any similar symptoms in close contacts or family members. Of note, during her trip to Boston (July 1-3), she dined at several restaurants, including a seafood establishment near the harbor. She also attended a community potluck in Portland on June 8, where she sampled various homemade dishes. The patient denies any recent antibiotic use, international travel, or contact with individuals known to have similar symptoms.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms and recent history, we suspect acute uncomplicated salmonellosis.\n2. Laboratory tests: Order stool culture and sensitivity to confirm Salmonella infection. Also, order complete blood count (CBC) and basic metabolic panel (BMP) to assess for signs of infection and dehydration.\n3. Hydration: Encourage oral rehydration with electrolyte solutions. If dehydration worsens, consider IV fluid administration.\n4. Symptom management: Recommend over-the-counter loperamide for diarrhea control, to be used cautiously and discontinued if fever worsens or blood appears in stool. Suggest acetaminophen for fever and headache.\n5. Nutrition: Advise BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) and gradual return to normal diet as tolerated.\n6. Antibiotics: Hold on antibiotic treatment unless patient develops signs of invasive disease or is at high risk for complications. Reassess need based on stool culture results and clinical course.\n7. Education: Instruct patient on proper hand hygiene and food safety measures to prevent spread of infection.\n8. Follow-up: Schedule follow-up appointment in 3-5 days to review test results and assess clinical improvement.\n9. Reporting: Report suspected case of Salmonella infection to local health department as per Maine state regulations.\n10. Work restrictions: Advise patient to stay home from work until diarrhea resolves, typically 4-7 days.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient reports being up-to-date on all recommended adult vaccinations, including annual flu shots. She received her last Tdap booster 3 years ago. No specific vaccines for Salmonella are routinely recommended or available for adults in the United States."

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 26-year-old white non-Hispanic female presented with severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps for 3 days, following recent travel to Boston. Symptoms began on July 6, 2024, with fever and nausea developing later. Lab tests on July 9 confirmed Salmonella infection. Treatment included oral rehydration, antidiarrheals, and eventually ciprofloxacin. The patient showed gradual improvement with medication and supportive care. The case highlights the typical progression of acute uncomplicated salmonellosis, from onset through diagnosis and treatment."
