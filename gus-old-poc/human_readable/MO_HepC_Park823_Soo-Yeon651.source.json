Initiate pain management with opioid analgesics, starting with low doses and titrating as needed.\n6. Begin antiemetic therapy for nausea.\n7. Consult nutrition for assessment and recommendations given weight loss and decreased appetite.\n8. Discuss case at multidisciplinary tumor board to determine best course of action (e.g., potential for local therapies vs. systemic treatment).\n9. Consult palliative care team for symptom management and goals of care discussion.\n10. Schedule follow-up with hepatology to reassess chronic hepatitis C management.\n11. Provide psychological support and consider referral to oncology social worker.\n12. Educate patient and family about prognosis and potential treatment options.\n13.

        "Summary": "This is a fictional representation of healthcare data intended for interoperability testing and solution development. The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 50-year-old Korean-American woman with chronic hepatitis C since 2014 and hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosed in 2023 presents with worsening abdominal pain and jaundice. Her condition has deteriorated despite previous treatments, including antiviral therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Current hospitalization reveals elevated liver enzymes, high AFP, and persistent HCV viremia. Imaging suggests tumor progression. The patient faces a poor prognosis, requiring aggressive treatment including potential TACE and radiation therapy, along with renewed antiviral treatment and supportive care."
