        "History of Travel Narrative": "Patient reports limited travel in recent months, all within Ohio. Most significant for hepatitis C management was a day trip to Columbus, OH on 2024-05-03 for a specialist appointment at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, specifically for hepatitis C management during pregnancy. Patient also attended a family reunion in Cincinnati, OH from 2024-06-15 to 2024-06-16, where she had close contact with extended family members, sharing meals and activities. This could be relevant for potential viral exposure or transmission risk. A routine shopping trip to Dayton Mall on 2024-04-20 involved use of public transportation and public facilities, which may present a low but potential risk for viral exposure. All travel was local and short-term, with no international travel reported. Patient's limited travel and use of public spaces align with recommendations for managing chronic hepatitis C during pregnancy, balancing necessary medical care with minimizing potential exposure risks."

        "History of Present Illness": "Keisha Washington is a 35-year-old G1P0 at 20 weeks 4 days gestation presenting for routine prenatal care and hepatitis C monitoring. She was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C in 2020 and has mild fibrosis. Patient reports increasing fatigue over the past month, which she attributes to both pregnancy and her hepatitis C status. She has been experiencing mild nausea, particularly in the mornings, for the past three weeks. Right upper quadrant discomfort began about two weeks ago, described as a dull ache, intermittent, and mild in intensity. Patient expresses anxiety about the potential impact of hepatitis C on her pregnancy and the risk of transmission to the baby. She has been adherent to prenatal vitamins and avoiding alcohol and tobacco. No signs of preterm labor or pregnancy complications noted.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Continue routine prenatal care with monthly visits.\n2. Perform comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count to assess liver function and rule out anemia.\n3. Schedule ultrasound at 28 weeks for fetal growth assessment and to evaluate liver and spleen size.\n4. Refer to maternal-fetal medicine specialist for consultation regarding management of hepatitis C in pregnancy.\n5. Recommend hepatitis A and B vaccines if not previously immunized.\n6. Discuss potential for antiviral therapy postpartum to reduce risk of vertical transmission.\n7. Provide patient education on hepatitis C transmission risks and precautions during pregnancy and postpartum.\n8. Refer to mental health services for management of pregnancy-related anxiety.\n9. Advise on dietary modifications to manage nausea and maintain adequate nutrition.\n10. Schedule follow-up in 4 weeks for continued monitoring.",
