The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 38-year-old Hispanic female hotel manager in Myrtle Beach developed moderate COVID-19 symptoms on June 27, 2024, including fever, cough, and fatigue. Recent travel and work interactions suggested potential exposure. Telemedicine consultation on June 30 confirmed COVID-19 through rapid antigen and PCR tests. Treatment plan included symptomatic care, home isolation, and monitoring. Patient had mild asthma history but no other significant medical conditions. Prognosis was good with expected recovery."
