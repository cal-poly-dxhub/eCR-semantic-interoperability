From November 1, 2023 to June 15, 2024, he was on the road frequently, staying at various truck stops and motels while making deliveries in multiple states. During this time, his occupation put him at potential risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) through activities like sharing personal items or engaging in high-risk behaviors. After June 15th, he returned to his home in Effingham, Illinois, where he has remained until the present time, with no recent travel history that would increase his risk further.",

He has no known chronic medical conditions and denies any prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Family history is unremarkable. He takes no routine medications.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Reports fatigue and decreased appetite for the past 2 months. Gastrointestinal: Complains of intermittent nausea and mild, dull abdominal pain for the past month. Denies vomiting, diarrhea, melena, or hematochezia. Musculoskeletal: Occasional mild muscle aches and body pains. All other systems reviewed and negative.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Wellman713 is a 52-year-old long-haul truck driver who presents for evaluation of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, decreased appetite, and muscle aches over the past 2-3 months. Symptoms have been gradually worsening. He denies fever, chills, jaundice, dark urine, or other associated symptoms. He has a history of extensive travel across multiple states for his job as a truck driver from November 2023 to mid-June 2024. He reports occasional alcohol use but denies any history of injection drug use. Sexual history is monogamous with his wife. He has no known sick contacts or other risk factors for viral hepatitis.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the history and risk factors, the leading diagnosis is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, likely acquired through occupational exposure during his long-haul trucking work. The plan is to obtain baseline labs including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and HCV antibody with reflex to quantitative HCV RNA viral load if positive. If HCV is confirmed, the patient will require staging with fibroscan or other non-invasive testing to assess degree of liver fibrosis. Presuming he has early-stage fibrosis, the treatment plan will involve direct-acting antiviral therapy with one of the newer pan-genotypic regimens for 8-12 weeks. Close monitoring of viral load and liver function tests during and after treatment. Counsel on avoiding alcohol and review transmission risks. Schedule follow-up in 1 week to discuss results.",
