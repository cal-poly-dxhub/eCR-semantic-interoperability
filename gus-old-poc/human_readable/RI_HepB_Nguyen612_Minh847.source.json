Patient's travel history and occupation in food service industry warrant consideration in the context of hepatitis B risk assessment and diagnosis."

        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Nguyen is a 32-year-old Vietnamese male who presents with a 2-week history of progressive fatigue, loss of appetite, and yellowing of his eyes. Symptoms began shortly after returning from a trip to Vietnam from May 1-15, 2024. He initially attributed his fatigue to jet lag but became concerned when it persisted and worsened. About 10 days ago, he noticed a decrease in appetite and mild nausea. Five days ago, his roommate pointed out a yellow tinge to his eyes. He has also observed darker urine over the past week. Patient denies fever, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. He works as a kitchen assistant in a restaurant and is worried about potential exposure to foodborne illnesses.

        "Summary": "This is a fictional representation of healthcare data intended for interoperability testing and solution development. The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 32-year-old Vietnamese male presented with fatigue, loss of appetite, and jaundice two weeks after returning from Vietnam. Lab tests revealed acute hepatitis B infection with positive HBsAg, HBeAg, and elevated liver enzymes. Patient's risk factors include recent travel, refugee status, and work in food service. Initial treatment included tenofovir, ursodeoxycholic acid, and supportive care. The case highlights the importance of hepatitis B screening in at-risk populations and prompt initiation of antiviral therapy upon diagnosis."
