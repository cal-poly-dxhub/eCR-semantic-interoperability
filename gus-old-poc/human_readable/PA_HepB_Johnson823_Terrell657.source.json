Three weeks prior to initial diagnosis, patient spent a weekend in Atlantic City, NJ, engaging in high-risk behaviors including sharing drinks and potentially contaminated items with friends. Patient also attended a local house party in Upper Darby, PA approximately 2.5 months ago, where he shared food, drinks, and possibly drug paraphernalia with acquaintances, presenting opportunities for blood-borne pathogen exposure. Patient's routine activities in Philadelphia, including use of public facilities and a visit to a free health clinic, while lower risk, are noted for completeness. This travel and social history suggests multiple potential exposure opportunities in the months leading up to diagnosis, particularly through shared items and possible high-risk behaviors."
