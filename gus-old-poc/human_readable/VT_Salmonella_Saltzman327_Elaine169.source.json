        "Past Medical History": "The patient is an 82-year-old female with a history of hypertension, osteoarthritis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She has no known drug allergies. Her surgical history includes a cholecystectomy in 1998 and a total knee replacement in 2016. She is a former smoker, having quit in 2005 after smoking for 40 years. She denies any recent travel outside of Vermont, except for a brief visit to her niece in Derby Line near the Canadian border on June 15-16, 2024.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Fatigue, fever, and chills. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Eyes: No icterus. Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Gastrointestinal: Diffuse abdominal tenderness, hyperactive bowel sounds, severe diarrhea. Genitourinary: No dysuria or hematuria. Musculoskeletal: No joint swelling or tenderness. Skin: No rashes or lesions. Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, no focal deficits. Psychiatric: Appropriate mood and affect.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is an 82-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She reports having 10-12 episodes of watery, non-bloody diarrhea per day, accompanied by cramping abdominal pain. She has been unable to tolerate any oral intake due to persistent nausea and vomiting. She denies any recent travel outside of Vermont, except for a brief visit to her niece in Derby Line near the Canadian border on June 15-16, 2024. She denies any sick contacts or recent antibiotic use. Her last bowel movement was earlier today, and she describes feeling weak and dizzy. On examination, she appeared ill and dehydrated, with dry mucous membranes and poor skin turgor.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "The patient was admitted to the hospital for management of severe dehydration secondary to acute gastroenteritis, likely due to a foodborne illness such as salmonella. She was started on intravenous fluids and antiemetics for symptomatic relief. Stool cultures were obtained to identify the causative organism. She was also started on empiric antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin pending culture results. Strict enteric precautions were implemented. Her electrolytes and renal function were closely monitored. Once her symptoms improved and she was able to tolerate oral intake, she was transitioned to oral antibiotics and discharged home with close follow-up. Emphasis was placed on hydration and a bland diet during her recovery.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports being up-to-date on her routine vaccinations, including the influenza vaccine last fall and the pneumococcal vaccines. However, she has not received any of the COVID-19 vaccines due to concerns about potential side effects given her age."
