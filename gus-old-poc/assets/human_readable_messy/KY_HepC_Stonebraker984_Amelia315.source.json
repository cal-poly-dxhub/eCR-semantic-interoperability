She denies any history of chronic medical conditions, surgeries, or hospitalizations. Family history is unremarkable for liver disease or cancer.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Fatigue and malaise present for several weeks. Gastrointestinal: Mild abdominal pain and nausea, loss of appetite. Musculoskeletal: Mild joint pains. All other systems reviewed and negative.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 48-year-old white female who presents with a several-week history of fatigue, malaise, mild abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, and joint pains. She reports that the fatigue started gradually around mid-October and has progressively worsened. The abdominal discomfort began about 3 weeks ago and is described as a dull, achy pain in the right upper quadrant. She has also experienced occasional nausea and decreased appetite over the past 2 weeks. Additionally, she has noticed some mild joint pains, primarily in her knees and wrists. She denies fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. She has not noticed any jaundice or dark urine. She has not had any recent travel, sick contacts, or high-risk exposures. Her last menstrual period was about 2 weeks ago. She takes no medications and has no known drug allergies.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the history and physical examination, the patient's presentation is concerning for chronic hepatitis C with mild fibrosis. The plan is to order serologic testing for hepatitis C virus antibody and viral load. If positive, we will proceed with a liver ultrasound and FibroScan to assess for fibrosis. Depending on the results, the patient may be a candidate for direct-acting antiviral therapy. We will also check routine labs including liver function tests, CBC, and hepatic function panel. The patient should be counseled on avoiding alcohol and practicing good hand hygiene. She will be scheduled for a follow-up visit in 2-3 weeks to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. With appropriate antiviral therapy and regular monitoring, the prognosis for this patient is good.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports being up-to-date on routine vaccinations including hepatitis B, but she is unsure of her hepatitis A vaccination status."
