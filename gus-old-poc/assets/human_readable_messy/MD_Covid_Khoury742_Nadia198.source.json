The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 28-year-old female software developer presented with mild COVID-19 symptoms after a business trip to New York City. She developed fever and cough on June 26, 2024, followed by fatigue and sore throat. On June 28, she visited an urgent care center where rapid antigen and PCR tests confirmed COVID-19. The patient, previously unvaccinated, was prescribed symptomatic treatment and home isolation. A telehealth follow-up was scheduled for June 30. The case highlights the importance of testing, isolation, and monitoring for mild COVID-19 cases."
