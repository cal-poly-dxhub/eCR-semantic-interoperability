He is a former smoker, having quit 5 years ago after a 30 pack-year smoking history. He has no known drug allergies. Family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in his father. He takes hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin for his chronic conditions.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Fatigue, fever, night sweats. Respiratory: Severe shortness of breath, productive cough with yellow sputum, pleuritic chest pain. Cardiovascular: No chest pain, palpitations, or edema. Gastrointestinal: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Genitourinary: No dysuria or hematuria. Musculoskeletal: No joint pains or swelling. Neurological: No headaches, dizziness, or focal deficits. Psychiatric: No depression or anxiety.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Montoya presented to the emergency department with a 4-day history of worsening shortness of breath, fever, fatigue, and cough productive of yellow sputum. His symptoms began with fatigue and low-grade fever on 6/21, followed by shortness of breath and cough on 6/22. Over the next few days, he developed pleuritic chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. He denied any recent travel or sick contacts. On presentation, he was febrile, tachycardic, hypotensive, and hypoxic requiring supplemental oxygen.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's presentation with acute respiratory failure and multi-organ dysfunction in the setting of COVID-19 infection, the treatment plan is as follows: 1) Initiate mechanical ventilation and admit to intensive care unit. 2) Start empiric antibiotics for possible bacterial superinfection. 3) Initiate remdesivir antiviral therapy. 4) Aggressive fluid resuscitation and vasopressor support for septic shock. 5) Renal replacement therapy for acute kidney injury. 6) Supportive care with correction of electrolyte abnormalities and nutritional support. 7) Monitor closely for any additional organ dysfunction. Overall prognosis is very poor given the severity of illness.",
