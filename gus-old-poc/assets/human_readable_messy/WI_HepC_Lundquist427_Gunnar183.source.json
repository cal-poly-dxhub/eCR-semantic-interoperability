        "Past Medical History": "Mr. Lundquist427 is a 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, genotype 1a. He was diagnosed with HCV in 2015 after routine bloodwork revealed elevated liver enzymes. Risk factors included a history of intravenous drug use in his youth. He underwent treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks in 2023 and achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks post-treatment. He has no other significant past medical history.",
        "Review of Systems": "A review of systems was performed and was negative except for the following: General: Denies fever, chills, fatigue, or weight changes. HEENT: Denies headaches, vision changes, or sore throat. Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations, or edema. Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. Genitourinary: Denies dysuria, hematuria, or urinary frequency. Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or swelling. Skin: Denies rashes or pruritus. Neurological: Denies dizziness, weakness, or numbness. Psychiatric: Denies anxiety, depression, or sleep disturbances.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Lundquist427 is a 62-year-old male who presents for follow-up after completing treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. He reports feeling well and denies any new symptoms. He completed a 12-week course of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir in January 2023 and achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) at 12 weeks post-treatment, with an undetectable HCV viral load. He has been adherent with follow-up appointments and laboratory monitoring. His most recent liver function tests and complete blood count were within normal limits. He denies any new risk factors for HCV transmission.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Continued monitoring for potential HCV relapse with HCV viral load testing every 6 months for the next 2 years. 2. Annual liver function tests and complete blood count to monitor for liver disease progression. 3. Counseling on risk factor avoidance and prevention of HCV transmission. 4. Referral to hepatology for consideration of treatment-related cirrhosis screening and surveillance. 5. Encourage routine age-appropriate cancer screening and preventive care. 6. Follow-up in 6 months or sooner if any new concerning symptoms develop.",
