On May 10, 2024, she received a new tattoo at a local parlor in Beckley, which involved potential exposure to blood-borne pathogens. On May 18, 2024, she attended an outdoor music festival in Fayetteville, where she used portable toilets and shared food and drinks with friends, presenting possible routes of transmission. Most recently, on May 25, 2024, she traveled to Charleston for a school debate competition, where she shared meals and close quarters with other students. These activities, particularly the tattoo procedure, present potential risk factors for hepatitis C transmission and align with the typical incubation period for acute, symptomatic hepatitis C."

        "History of Present Illness": "Haley Adkins, an 18-year-old female, presents with a 5-day history of progressive fatigue, followed by the onset of jaundice and abdominal pain 3 days ago. She first noticed feeling unusually tired after school on May 28, 2024. On May 30, she observed yellowing of her skin and eyes, which prompted concern. Concurrently, she developed a dull, aching pain in her upper right abdomen. The pain is described as moderate, constant, and not radiating. She reports associated nausea but no vomiting. Her appetite has decreased, and she's noticed her urine becoming darker over the past few days. She denies fever, chills, or any respiratory symptoms.

        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, we suspect acute hepatitis C infection. We will confirm with HCV RNA testing.\n2. Patient Education: Explain the nature of hepatitis C, its transmission, and prognosis. Emphasize the importance of rest and hydration.\n3. Supportive Care: Recommend adequate rest and increased fluid intake. Advise on a balanced, nutritious diet as tolerated.\n4. Monitoring: Schedule follow-up appointments to track liver function tests and monitor symptom progression.\n5. Antiviral Therapy: Given the acute nature of the infection, we will closely monitor for spontaneous clearance over the next 12-16 weeks before considering antiviral therapy.\n6. Lifestyle Modifications: Advise complete abstinence from alcohol and avoidance of hepatotoxic medications.\n7. Prevention: Counsel on preventing transmission to others, including safe sex practices and avoiding sharing personal items that may come into contact with blood.\n8. Psychosocial Support: Offer resources for counseling and support groups if needed.\n9. Further Testing: Screen for other hepatitis viruses (A and B) and HIV.\n10. Referral: Consider referral to a hepatologist for specialized management if symptoms worsen or persist.\n11. Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 1 week to reassess symptoms and review all test results.",

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. An 18-year-old female presented with fatigue, jaundice, and abdominal pain. Symptoms began on May 28, 2024, with jaundice appearing on May 30. Recent history included a tattoo on May 10 and attendance at a music festival on May 18. Lab tests on June 2 revealed elevated liver enzymes, positive HCV antibodies, and high viral load, leading to a diagnosis of acute hepatitis C. Treatment focused on supportive care, including acetaminophen for pain, ondansetron for nausea, and ursodeoxycholic acid to improve bile flow. The patient's prognosis is good with anticipated full recovery."
