His BMI of 31.2 indicates obesity. He is a former smoker, having quit 5 years ago after smoking for 20 years. He denies any other significant past medical history.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Fatigue, fever, and chills present. Respiratory: Severe shortness of breath, productive cough with yellow sputum, chest tightness. Cardiovascular: No chest pain or palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Nausea and diarrhea present. Musculoskeletal: Generalized muscle aches. Neurological: Headache present, no focal deficits. All other systems reviewed and negative.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 53-year-old Chamorro male who presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and headache. He states that his symptoms started with a mild cough and fatigue on May 24th, but rapidly progressed over the next few days with the development of high fever, severe shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. He denies any recent travel outside of Guam, but did take a vacation to Honolulu, Hawaii approximately 1 month ago. He has no known exposure to anyone with COVID-19. His symptoms have been progressively worsening despite taking over-the-counter medications for fever and cough.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's presentation and history, he is being admitted to the intensive care unit for management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia with acute respiratory failure. The initial plan includes initiation of remdesivir antiviral therapy, dexamethasone for inflammation, prophylactic anticoagulation, and close monitoring of respiratory status. If respiratory status continues to decline, he may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Broad-spectrum antibiotics will be initiated to cover potential secondary bacterial pneumonia. Supportive care with intravenous fluids, oxygen supplementation, and symptom management will be provided. Daily multidisciplinary rounds will be held to assess progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. The patient's underlying comorbidities of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity put him at high risk for severe complications, so close monitoring and aggressive management will be crucial.",
