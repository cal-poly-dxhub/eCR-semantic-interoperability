Gastrointestinal: Abdominal discomfort, nausea, dark urine. Genitourinary: Unremarkable. Musculoskeletal: Unremarkable. Neurological: Unremarkable. Psychiatric: Denies depression or anxiety. Endocrine: Unremarkable. Hematologic: Unremarkable. Allergies: No known drug allergies.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 19-year-old Vietnamese female who presents with a 6-week history of progressive fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, and jaundice. She denies fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. She reports no recent travel outside of the New Orleans area. She attended New Year's Eve celebrations in the French Quarter approximately 5 months ago but denies high-risk behaviors. She has no known sick contacts. Her symptoms have gradually worsened over the past month, prompting her to seek medical evaluation today.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Laboratory testing: CBC, CMP, PT/INR, hepatitis panel. 2. Imaging: Abdominal ultrasound to evaluate liver and biliary tract. 3. Diagnosis: Based on clinical presentation and positive hepatitis B serology, the patient likely has chronic hepatitis B infection with HBeAg positivity, indicating high viral replication and increased risk of liver disease progression. 4. Treatment: Start antiviral therapy with tenofovir or entecavir after discussing risks/benefits with patient. 5. Monitoring: Regular follow-up with lab monitoring of viral load and liver function tests. Liver biopsy may be considered to stage fibrosis. 6. Referral: Hepatology consultation for long-term management.",
