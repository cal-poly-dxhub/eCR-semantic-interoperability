Repeat chest X-ray in 48-72 hours to assess progression.\n11. Consult respiratory therapy for chest physiotherapy.\n12. Provide nutritional support and encourage oral hydration.\n13. Assess for clinical improvement daily; if worsening, consider high-flow oxygen or ICU transfer.\n14. Initiate discharge planning, including arrangement for home oxygen if needed.\n15.
