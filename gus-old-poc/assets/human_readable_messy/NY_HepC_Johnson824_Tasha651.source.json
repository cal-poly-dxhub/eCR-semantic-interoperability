On June 15, 2024, patient attended a social gathering in the Bronx, sharing food and drinks with others, which could present a low risk of viral transmission if proper hygiene wasn't maintained. On May 20, 2024, patient visited a crowded health clinic in Manhattan for a routine check-up, where extended time in a waiting room could theoretically pose a risk of exposure to blood-borne pathogens. Most notably, on April 2, 2024, patient visited a family member in Brooklyn who was recently diagnosed with hepatitis C. Close contact and shared meal during this visit represent a potential risk factor for transmission, especially if there were any unnoticed blood exposures. Patient's frequent use of public transportation, including subway, may also present opportunities for accidental exposure to contaminated surfaces or needlestick injuries, though this risk is generally low."

        "Summary": "This is a fictional representation of healthcare data intended for interoperability testing and solution development. The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. Tasha Johnson, a 42-year-old female with a history of IV drug use and alcohol abuse, presented to the ER with severe abdominal pain and jaundice. Lab tests revealed elevated liver enzymes and positive HCV antibody and RNA. Ultrasound showed hepatomegaly and early cirrhotic changes. Diagnosed with acute hepatitis C and liver damage, she was admitted for further evaluation and treatment. Antiviral therapy with Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir was initiated, along with supportive care. Patient's history suggests recent HCV exposure, possibly from a family member or past drug use."
