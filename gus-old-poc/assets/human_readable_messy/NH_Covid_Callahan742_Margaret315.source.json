These activities may have involved potential COVID-19 exposure in community settings. Patient also traveled to Boston, MA from 2024-06-15 to 2024-06-16 for a specialist consultation at Massachusetts General Hospital, with overnight stay in a hotel. This medical visit and use of public transportation (bus) could have increased risk of COVID-19 exposure. A day trip to Concord, NH on 2024-05-20 for a family gathering in an outdoor park setting is noted, presenting a lower but still present risk of COVID-19 transmission. Given patient's age (78) and the current COVID-19 concern, all these travel events, particularly those involving indoor or crowded settings, are relevant for potential exposure and transmission risk assessment."

        "History of Present Illness": "Margaret Callahan, a 78-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with complaints of worsening shortness of breath and fever. The patient reports that her symptoms began approximately 4 days ago with fatigue and a mild cough. Over the past 2 days, she developed a fever, and her breathing became increasingly labored. She notes that her usual activities, such as walking to the mailbox, now leave her breathless. The patient also mentions experiencing body aches, a mild headache, and a sore throat. She denies any known recent exposure to COVID-19 but did attend a church service and a senior center book club meeting in the past week. The patient's family members report that she has seemed more confused over the last 24 hours. Given her age and medical history, particularly her COPD, the patient and her family became concerned and decided to seek medical attention. The patient has not traveled outside of New Hampshire recently, except for a day trip to Boston for a medical appointment about three weeks ago.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient to the COVID-19 unit for close monitoring and management.\n2. Initiate oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 94%.\n3. Start antiviral therapy with remdesivir 200 mg IV on day 1, followed by 100 mg IV daily for 4 days.\n4. Administer dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days.\n5. Continue patient's home medications for hypertension, diabetes, and COPD.\n6. Monitor fluid status and electrolytes; initiate IV fluids if necessary.\n7. Obtain daily CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ferritin, D-dimer).\n8. Perform daily chest X-rays to monitor for progression of pulmonary involvement.\n9. Initiate DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily.\n10. Provide supportive care including antipyretics and cough suppressants as needed.\n11. Monitor for signs of clinical deterioration and be prepared to escalate care if needed.\n12. Consult Infectious Disease specialist for additional management recommendations.\n13. Arrange for physical therapy and respiratory therapy evaluations.\n14. Educate patient and family about COVID-19, including isolation precautions and prognosis.\n15. Assess and address any anxiety or mental health concerns related to diagnosis and hospitalization.\n16. Begin discharge planning early, including arrangement for home oxygen if needed upon discharge.",
