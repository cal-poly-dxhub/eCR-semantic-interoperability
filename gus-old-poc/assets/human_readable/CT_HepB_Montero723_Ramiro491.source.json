        "Reason for Visit": "Fatigue, abdominal discomfort, and other symptoms concerning for hepatitis.",
        "Past Medical History": "The patient has no significant past medical history. He reports being generally healthy prior to the onset of his current symptoms. There is no history of chronic medical conditions, surgeries, or hospitalizations. His immunization status is uncertain, as he does not recall receiving the hepatitis B vaccine series.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Fatigue, decreased appetite. HEENT: Scleral icterus noted, no other abnormalities. Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal heart sounds. Gastrointestinal: Mild epigastric tenderness, no rebound or guarding. Genitourinary: No complaints. Musculoskeletal: No joint pains or swelling. Skin: Jaundiced appearance. Neurological: No focal deficits. Psychiatric: Mood and affect are appropriate.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 50-year-old Hispanic male who presents with a 1-month history of progressive fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, and dark urine. He first noticed feeling unusually tired in mid-March but attributed it to his physically demanding job as a construction worker. However, the fatigue worsened over time, and he developed intermittent abdominal pain and nausea in early April. He also noticed his urine becoming darker in color around April 12th. Over the past week, he has developed jaundice. The patient denies fever, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. He has no known sick contacts or recent travel apart from a trip to Tijuana, Mexico in late December to visit family. His symptoms have been gradually worsening, prompting him to seek medical evaluation today.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the history and physical exam findings, the patient likely has acute hepatitis B infection with mild fibrosis. The diagnostic workup will include serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, IgM anti-HBc, and viral load. If hepatitis B is confirmed, a fibroscan will be ordered to assess the degree of liver fibrosis. Treatment will involve initiating antiviral therapy with a nucleos(t)ide analogue such as tenofovir or entecavir. The patient will require regular monitoring of liver function tests, viral load, and fibroscan to assess treatment response and disease progression. Counseling on lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding alcohol and hepatotoxic agents, will be provided. With appropriate treatment and monitoring, the prognosis is favorable for achieving sustained viral suppression and preventing further liver damage. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at regular intervals to monitor his clinical status and adjust treatment as needed.",
