All travel was local within upstate New York, primarily using retirement home shuttle services. These activities present potential COVID-19 exposure risks due to close contact with multiple individuals in indoor settings, particularly given the patient's residence in a communal living environment."

        "Past Medical History": "Patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery in 2015 for coronary artery disease. The patient is a former smoker with a 40 pack-year history, having quit in 2010. He also has a history of recurrent pneumonia, with his last episode occurring in 2023.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Positive for fatigue and fever. Respiratory: Positive for shortness of breath and cough. Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain or palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Negative for nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Musculoskeletal: Positive for generalized muscle aches. Neurological: Positive for mild confusion. Skin: Negative for rashes. HEENT: Negative for sore throat or runny nose. Genitourinary: Negative for urinary symptoms.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Fitzgerald is a 78-year-old male resident of a retirement community who presents with a 3-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and fever. Symptoms began on 2024-05-16 with mild dyspnea and a dry cough. On 2024-05-17, he developed a fever, measured at home as 38.3\u00b0C (101\u00b0F), along with increased fatigue and muscle aches. Today (2024-05-18), his shortness of breath has significantly worsened, and he reports feeling mildly confused. He denies any recent travel outside of his local area but mentions attending a crowded bingo night at the Saratoga Senior Center on 2024-05-15 and a medical appointment in Albany on 2024-05-10. Given his age, comorbidities, and residence in a communal living environment, there is a high suspicion for COVID-19 infection.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient to isolation room for suspected COVID-19 infection. 2. Obtain nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. 3. Initiate supplemental oxygen therapy via nasal cannula to maintain SpO2 > 94%. 4. Start IV fluids for hydration. 5. Administer acetaminophen for fever and pain relief. 6. Begin empiric antiviral therapy with remdesivir. 7. Start dexamethasone 6 mg daily for moderate COVID-19. 8. Monitor vital signs, including continuous pulse oximetry. 9. Obtain chest X-ray to assess for pneumonia. 10. Order complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. 11. Initiate DVT prophylaxis with enoxaparin. 12. Continue home medications for chronic conditions. 13. Consult pulmonology for management of COPD in the context of suspected COVID-19. 14. Implement prone positioning if oxygenation worsens. 15. Educate patient on importance of self-proning and incentive spirometry. 16. Notify the local health department of suspected COVID-19 case. 17. Arrange for contact tracing within the retirement community. 18. Reassess frequently for any signs of clinical deterioration requiring escalation of care.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient reports receiving two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in early 2021, followed by a booster dose in late 2021. However, he is unsure about subsequent boosters and cannot recall receiving any additional doses in the past year."
