        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Mendoza is a 41-year-old Hispanic male presenting with a 3-day history of severe abdominal pain and diarrhea, followed by rapidly progressing muscle weakness. The illness began on 5/25/2024 with the sudden onset of cramping abdominal pain and watery diarrhea occurring 6-8 times per day. He also experienced fever (measured at home as high as 39\u00b0C) and nausea. On 5/27/2024, he noticed weakness in his legs, which rapidly progressed to his arms over the next 24 hours. By the morning of 5/28/2024, he had difficulty walking and performing simple tasks like buttoning his shirt. He also reported a tingling sensation in his hands and feet, and noticed that his face felt 'droopy'. The patient became alarmed when he started experiencing mild difficulty breathing, which prompted him to seek emergency care. Of note, the patient reports recent travel to Mexico City from 4/5/2024 to 4/12/2024, where he attended a large family gathering and consumed street food.

        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring of respiratory function and progression of neurological symptoms.\n2. Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy at a dose of 0.4 g/kg daily for 5 days for treatment of suspected Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n3. Start ciprofloxacin 500mg IV every 12 hours for treatment of suspected Salmonella infection.\n4. Obtain stool culture and sensitivity to confirm Salmonella infection and guide antibiotic therapy.\n5. Perform lumbar puncture for CSF analysis to support diagnosis of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n6. Initiate neurophysiological studies (nerve conduction studies and electromyography) to confirm and characterize Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n7. Monitor respiratory function closely with regular spirometry and negative inspiratory force measurements. Be prepared for potential need for mechanical ventilation.\n8. Initiate physical therapy and occupational therapy for muscle strengthening and to prevent complications of immobility.\n9. Provide deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous heparin and compression stockings.\n10. Manage pain and other symptoms as needed.\n11. Consult with neurology and infectious disease specialists for ongoing management.\n12. Educate patient and family about the course of illness, expected outcomes, and potential complications.\n13. Plan for long-term follow-up and rehabilitation as patient's condition improves.",
