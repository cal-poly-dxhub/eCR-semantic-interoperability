He attended a large family gathering with homemade food and ate at local restaurants and public markets. This travel to an area with potentially less regulated food safety practices increases risk of Salmonella exposure. Patient also attended a local food festival in Dallas on June 25, 2024, sampling various street foods, which could be another potential source of Salmonella infection if proper food handling was not observed. Earlier travel to Houston for a food service conference from May 10-12, 2024 included sampling various food items, but this was likely too far removed from symptom onset to be the source of infection."

        "Summary": "This is a fictional representation of healthcare data intended for interoperability testing and solution development. The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 32-year-old Hispanic male presented to the ER on July 1, 2024, with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever that began on June 28, shortly after returning from Mexico. Stool culture confirmed Salmonella enteritis. The patient developed joint pain and swelling on July 1, diagnosed as reactive arthritis. Treatment included antibiotics, IV fluids, and NSAIDs. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms improved, but joint issues persisted, requiring ongoing monitoring and physical therapy. The case highlights the progression from acute Salmonella infection to reactive arthritis."
