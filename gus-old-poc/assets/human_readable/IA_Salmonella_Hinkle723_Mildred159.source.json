On 2024-06-22, she visited a local farmer's market in Elkhorn, IA, where she purchased and consumed unpasteurized dairy products and sampled various food items from vendor stalls. This exposure to potentially contaminated food is a significant risk factor for Salmonella infection. Prior to this, from 2024-06-15 to 2024-06-17, the patient attended a family reunion picnic in Des Moines, IA, where she consumed homemade foods including potato salad and grilled chicken, both of which can be sources of Salmonella if improperly prepared or stored. Additionally, on 2024-06-10, the patient participated in a community potluck dinner in Elkhorn, IA, consuming various homemade dishes prepared by others, which presents another opportunity for exposure to foodborne pathogens. These multiple instances of consuming potentially high-risk foods from various sources in the weeks preceding her illness are noteworthy in the context of her current condition."

        "History of Present Illness": "Mrs. Hinkle is a 72-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. The diarrhea began suddenly on 6/23/2024, initially watery and frequent (>10 times per day), without blood or mucus. She reports associated fever, with home measurements up to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). The patient also complains of severe, diffuse abdominal pain, described as cramping and constant. Nausea and vomiting started on 6/24/2024, further compromising her oral intake and hydration status. She denies any recent travel outside of Iowa but mentions attending a family reunion picnic in Des Moines from 6/15 to 6/17, where she consumed homemade foods. She also reports visiting a local farmer's market on 6/22, where she sampled unpasteurized dairy products. The patient has been taking ibuprofen for pain relief, which has been minimally effective. She denies any sick contacts or similar symptoms in family members. Her last normal bowel movement was on 6/22/2024.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient to ICU for management of severe salmonellosis and septic shock.\n2. Initiate aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids, targeting MAP >65 mmHg and urine output >0.5 mL/kg/hr.\n3. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics: IV ceftriaxone 2g q24h and IV ciprofloxacin 400mg q12h, pending blood and stool culture results.\n4. Initiate vasopressor support with norepinephrine if fluid resuscitation alone is insufficient to maintain adequate blood pressure.\n5. Insert central venous catheter for administration of medications and monitoring of central venous pressure.\n6. Place urinary catheter to monitor urine output closely.\n7. Obtain blood cultures (2 sets), stool culture, and stool PCR for gastrointestinal pathogens.\n8. Laboratory studies: CBC with differential, CMP, lactate, coagulation studies, and blood gas analysis q6h.\n9. Continuous cardiac monitoring and hourly vital signs.\n10. Initiate enteral nutrition as soon as tolerated to maintain gut mucosal integrity.\n11. Consider stress ulcer prophylaxis with IV pantoprazole.\n12. Implement early mobilization as patient's condition allows to prevent ICU-acquired weakness.\n13. Consult Infectious Disease for antibiotic management and Nephrology for potential need for renal replacement therapy.\n14. Daily reassessment of fluid status, organ function, and need for continued ICU level care.\n15. Educate patient and family about the severity of the condition, expected course, and potential complications.",

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 72-year-old white female presented with severe diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain on 2024-06-24. She was diagnosed with Salmonella sepsis and septic shock, likely due to recent consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. The patient was admitted to ICU, receiving aggressive fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and vasopressor support. Despite treatment, she developed acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances. Her condition remained critical with a poor prognosis and high risk of complications, reflecting the severity of salmonellosis and septic shock in an elderly patient with pre-existing conditions."
