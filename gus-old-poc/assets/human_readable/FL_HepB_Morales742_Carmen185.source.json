She stayed with family and engaged in various social activities. Prior to this, patient traveled to Miami, Florida from March 20-22, 2024 for a specialist medical appointment, staying at a budget hotel. On February 14, 2024, patient made a day trip to Orlando, Florida for a social event. Given the patient's active, severe hepatitis C infection and pregnancy status, these travels, particularly the longer stay in Puerto Rico, may have implications for her condition management and risk of complications. The medical visit to Miami could be relevant to her hepatitis C treatment or pregnancy care. No international travel outside the US and its territories was reported."

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 30-year-old pregnant Hispanic woman with chronic hepatitis C presents to the ED with severe abdominal pain, fatigue, and jaundice. She is 8 weeks pregnant and has been non-compliant with hepatitis C treatment due to lack of insurance. Lab results show elevated liver enzymes and high viral load. The patient is admitted for management of active hepatitis C in pregnancy, with concerns for high risk of complications. Treatment includes antiviral therapy, symptom management, and close monitoring of both maternal and fetal health."
