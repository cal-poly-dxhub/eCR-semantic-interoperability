On July 1-2, 2024, she attended a technology conference in Seattle, which likely involved close contact with numerous individuals in indoor settings. On June 28, 2024, she visited a busy farmers market and restaurant in downtown Bellevue, as well as participating in a group prenatal yoga class. Earlier, from June 21-23, 2024, she traveled to Portland, Oregon for a family reunion, which included visits to crowded public spaces. These activities, particularly those involving indoor gatherings or crowded areas, could have increased her risk of COVID-19 exposure. Patient's use of public transit on June 28 is also noted as a potential source of exposure."
