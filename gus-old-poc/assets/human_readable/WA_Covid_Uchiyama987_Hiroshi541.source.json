He recently returned from a trip to Tokyo, Japan on April 22nd, where he visited family and attended gatherings. His symptoms began on June 24th with a mild cough and fatigue, which he initially attributed to jet lag. However, over the next few days, he developed high-grade fevers, worsening shortness of breath, chest tightness, and generalized muscle aches. He denied any recent sick contacts or known COVID-19 exposures. On the day of presentation, his respiratory distress had become severe, prompting him to seek emergency care.",

He will be admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and respiratory support. Initiate supplemental oxygen therapy, IV fluids, and empiric antibiotics (ceftriaxone and azithromycin) pending COVID-19 test results. Order a chest X-ray, complete metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers. Consult pulmonology and infectious disease for further management. Strict isolation precautions will be implemented. Administer remdesivir and dexamethasone if COVID-19 is confirmed. Monitor closely for potential respiratory decompensation and the need for mechanical ventilation. Provide supportive care and manage any complications.",
