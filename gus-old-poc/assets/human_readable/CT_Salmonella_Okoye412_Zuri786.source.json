        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or weight changes. Gastrointestinal: Reports abdominal cramps and diarrhea for the past 24 hours, with nausea and occasional vomiting. Denies blood in stool. Genitourinary: No issues. Musculoskeletal: No complaints. Neurological: Reports mild headache. Respiratory: No cough or shortness of breath. Skin: No rashes or lesions. Psychiatric: Mood is appropriate.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 29-year-old Black female who presented with a one-day history of abdominal cramps and diarrhea. She reports having 5-6 episodes of watery, non-bloody diarrhea since yesterday morning, accompanied by moderate abdominal cramps and mild nausea. This morning, she developed a low-grade fever of 38.1\u00b0C, mild headache, and occasional vomiting. She denies any recent travel outside of the New London area, except for a business trip to New York City and a vacation in Boston within the past month. She reports dining at a local restaurant upon her return from New York City. Her symptoms began the following day. She has no known sick contacts or recent antibiotic use.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's clinical presentation and history, the most likely diagnosis is mild salmonellosis, likely acquired through consumption of contaminated food or water. The plan is as follows: 1) Stool culture to confirm the diagnosis and identify the specific strain of Salmonella. 2) Oral rehydration therapy with electrolyte-containing fluids to prevent dehydration. 3) Anti-emetic medication (ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting as needed. 4) Symptomatic treatment with over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication (loperamide) if diarrhea persists. 5) Strict hand hygiene and food safety precautions to prevent transmission. 6) Follow-up in 2-3 days if symptoms persist or worsen. With appropriate management, the patient is expected to make a full recovery within 5-7 days.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports being up-to-date on routine vaccinations, including the influenza vaccine for the current season. However, she has not received the typhoid vaccine, which is recommended for travelers to certain areas with a high risk of typhoid fever."
