        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Positive for fatigue, malaise. Negative for weight loss, fever, chills. HEENT: Negative for sore throat, ear pain, nasal congestion. Respiratory: Positive for cough. Negative for shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain. Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain, palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Negative for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain. Genitourinary: Negative for dysuria, hematuria. Musculoskeletal: Positive for myalgia. Negative for joint pain, swelling. Skin: Negative for rash. Neurological: Negative for headache, dizziness, weakness. Psychiatric: Negative for depression, anxiety.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 35-year-old female who presents with a 3-day history of cough, fever, fatigue, and malaise. The cough is productive of a small amount of clear sputum. The fever has been low-grade, with a maximum temperature of 101.2\u00b0F. The fatigue and malaise have been moderate in severity, but have not interfered with her ability to perform activities of daily living. She denies any shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She reports having recently traveled to Boston for a business trip from December 10-12, 2023, where she attended an accounting conference and met with clients. She stayed at the Hilton Boston Downtown/Faneuil Hall and traveled by rental car. Apart from this trip, she reports normal daily activities around her hometown of Middlebury, VT during the month of December 2023 with travel by personal vehicle.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is mild COVID-19 infection. The plan is to treat her symptoms with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen for fever and cough suppressants as needed. She should also get plenty of rest and stay well-hydrated. I will order a COVID-19 PCR test to confirm the diagnosis. If the test is positive, she should isolate at home for at least 5 days and until she has been fever-free for 24 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications. She should also wear a well-fitted mask around others for an additional 5 days. If her symptoms worsen or if she develops shortness of breath, she should seek medical attention immediately. Given her age and lack of significant comorbidities, her prognosis is good, and a full recovery is expected.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports having received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in March and April of 2021, as well as a bivalent booster dose in October 2022."
