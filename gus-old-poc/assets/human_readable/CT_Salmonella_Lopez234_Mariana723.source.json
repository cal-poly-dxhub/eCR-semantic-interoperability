A 62-year-old Hispanic female presented with severe salmonella gastroenteritis complicated by sepsis following a church potluck. She rapidly decompensated, requiring ICU admission for septic shock with respiratory failure and acute kidney injury. Despite aggressive treatment with antibiotics, fluids, vasopressors, and organ support, her condition remained critical with a guarded prognosis."
