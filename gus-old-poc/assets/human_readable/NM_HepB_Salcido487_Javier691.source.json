        "Past Medical History": "The patient is a 42-year-old Hispanic male with a history of chronic hepatitis B virus infection since childhood. He was diagnosed as an inactive carrier around age 30 after routine screening. He has been closely monitored with regular liver function tests and viral load measurements. His hepatitis B has remained in the inactive carrier state with low or undetectable viral loads and normal liver enzymes. He has no other significant past medical history.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, fatigue, or weight changes. HEENT: Denies headaches, vision changes, sore throat, or mouth sores. Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations, or edema. Gastrointestinal: Denies abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or jaundice. Genitourinary: Denies dysuria, hematuria, or urinary frequency. Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain, swelling, or muscle weakness. Skin: Denies rashes, pruritus, or skin lesions. Neurological: Denies dizziness, numbness, tingling, or weakness. Psychiatric: Denies depression, anxiety, or sleep disturbances.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient presents today for routine follow-up of his chronic hepatitis B inactive carrier state. He denies any new symptoms or concerns. He reports feeling well overall with no complaints. His last viral load measurement 6 months ago showed an undetectable level, and his liver enzymes have remained within normal limits for several years. He continues to follow a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise. He has no recent travel history or other risk factors for hepatitis B reactivation.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Repeat hepatitis B viral load and liver function tests today. 2. Counsel patient on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and avoiding hepatotoxic exposures. 3. Advise patient to continue routine monitoring every 6-12 months with viral load, liver enzymes, and focused physical exam. 4. Reinforce education on recognizing signs/symptoms of hepatitis B reactivation and when to seek medical attention. 5. Discuss hepatitis B treatment options should his status change from inactive carrier. 6. Schedule follow-up appointment in 6 months.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports completing the hepatitis B vaccine series as a child but does not have documentation available."
