He is a former smoker with a 30 pack-year history, quitting 15 years ago. He has no known drug allergies. His surgical history includes a cholecystectomy in 2010. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease in his father.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Fatigue, fever, chills. Respiratory: Severe shortness of breath, productive cough with yellow sputum, chest tightness. Cardiovascular: No chest pain, no palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Decreased appetite, nausea, diarrhea. Genitourinary: No dysuria or urgency. Musculoskeletal: Generalized muscle aches. Neurological: No headaches, dizziness, or focal deficits. Skin: No rashes or lesions.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is an 80-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes who presented to the emergency department with a 5-day history of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough, fever, and fatigue. He reports having had a mild cough and feeling more tired than usual about a week ago, which he initially attributed to his age and chronic conditions. However, over the past few days, he developed high fevers up to 39.5\u00b0C, severe shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and a worsening cough productive of yellow sputum. He also reports having had some nausea, diarrhea, and generalized muscle aches. He denied any recent travel or known exposure to individuals with respiratory illness.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's presentation and history, he was diagnosed with severe COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). He was admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and management. Treatment included supplemental oxygen, intravenous fluids, remdesivir, dexamethasone, and prophylactic anticoagulation. Despite maximal medical therapy, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate with worsening hypoxemia and multi-organ failure. After a family meeting, the decision was made to transition to comfort measures only. The patient was transferred to the palliative care service and passed away peacefully on June 13th, 2024.",
