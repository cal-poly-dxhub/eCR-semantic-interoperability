These recent dining experiences, particularly the questionable chicken salad and exposure to buffet-style food service, may be relevant to the patient's current presentation of salmonella poisoning."

        "History of Present Illness": "Linh Nguyen, a 39-year-old Asian female, presents to the ER with a 2-day history of severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. Symptoms began approximately 24 hours after attending a local food festival where she consumed various foods, including a chicken salad that she reports tasted 'slightly off'. The abdominal pain is described as crampy, diffuse, and worsening over time. Diarrhea is watery, occurring >6 times daily, without visible blood. Nausea and vomiting started yesterday, further compromising oral intake. Patient also reports a fever, though not measured at home. She has attempted to manage symptoms with over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication and oral rehydration solutions, but with minimal relief. Of note, patient traveled to Atlanta for a business trip 10 days ago, where she ate at several restaurants including a buffet. She denies similar symptoms in family members or close contacts. Patient is concerned about dehydration due to persistent symptoms and reduced oral intake.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit patient for observation and management of moderate salmonella gastroenteritis.\n2. Initiate IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution to address dehydration.\n3. Collect stool samples for culture and sensitivity testing to confirm Salmonella infection.\n4. Symptomatic treatment:\n   a. Ondansetron 4mg IV q6h as needed for nausea and vomiting\n   b. Acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h for fever and pain\n5. Monitor electrolytes and renal function; correct as needed.\n6. Initiate clear liquid diet as tolerated, advance as symptoms improve.\n7. Hold antibiotics pending culture results and clinical course, as most cases of non-invasive salmonellosis are self-limiting.\n8. Educate patient on proper hand hygiene and food safety practices.\n9. Notify local health department of suspected salmonella case.\n10. Reassess in 24 hours for clinical improvement. If no improvement or worsening symptoms, consider blood cultures and possible antibiotic therapy.\n11. Discharge planning to include follow-up with PCP within 1 week and dietary counseling.",
