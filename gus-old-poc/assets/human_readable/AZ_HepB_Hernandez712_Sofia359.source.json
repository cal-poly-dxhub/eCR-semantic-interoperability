She has been followed closely by her primary care provider and a hepatologist. Her HBV viral load has remained low, and her liver function tests have been within normal limits. She has no history of cirrhosis, liver cancer, or other significant medical conditions. Her family history is unremarkable for liver disease.",
        "Review of Systems": "The patient denies any current symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, or pruritus. She reports no changes in appetite, weight, or bowel habits. She denies fever, chills, or night sweats. Her review of systems is otherwise unremarkable.",

She was diagnosed with chronic HBV in 2012 during routine screening and has been closely monitored since then. Her HBV viral load has remained low, and her liver function tests have been within normal limits. She denies any new symptoms or concerns. She continues to follow a healthy lifestyle and adheres to her recommended follow-up schedule.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Continue routine monitoring of HBV viral load and liver function tests every 6 months. 2. Encourage adherence to a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of alcohol and hepatotoxic substances. 3. Reinforce the importance of safe sexual practices and avoiding sharing personal items that may expose others to HBV. 4. Recommend annual screening for hepatocellular carcinoma with abdominal ultrasound and alpha-fetoprotein levels. 5. Discuss the potential benefits and risks of antiviral therapy if viral load or liver function tests become abnormal. 6. Provide education on the importance of lifetime monitoring and management of chronic HBV infection.",
