To find key-value pairs relevant to the query "pregnant", I will scan through the list of pairs and look for values that contain information related to pregnancy status, gestational age, estimated due date, or other details indicating the patient is pregnant. I'll include any pairs where the value explicitly mentions pregnancy or contains relevant data about the pregnancy.
