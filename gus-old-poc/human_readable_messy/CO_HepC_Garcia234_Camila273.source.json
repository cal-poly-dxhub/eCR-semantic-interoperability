She reports a recent trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, from May 15-22, 2024, where she engaged in beach activities and dining out. No significant past medical history otherwise.",

Neurological: No headaches, dizziness, or focal weakness. Psychiatric: Denies anxiety or depression. Endocrine: No heat or cold intolerance. Hematologic: No easy bruising or bleeding.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Garcia is a 30-year-old Hispanic female who presents with a one-week history of fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, and low-grade fever. She reports that her symptoms started gradually about 5 days after returning from a vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The fatigue and loss of appetite were the first symptoms, followed by nausea and abdominal discomfort a couple of days later. She noticed a mild fever and yellowing of her skin and eyes yesterday. She denies any vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in bowel habits. She also denies any recent illnesses, sick contacts, or high-risk behaviors.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the patient is diagnosed with acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, likely acquired during her recent travel to Mexico. The plan is to start her on a 12-week course of direct-acting antiviral therapy with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. She will need close monitoring with regular liver function tests and HCV RNA levels. Supportive care with adequate hydration and rest is also recommended. A follow-up appointment is scheduled in 2 weeks to assess her response to treatment and address any concerns or side effects.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient reports being up-to-date on routine vaccinations but has not received the hepatitis A or hepatitis B vaccines."

        "Summary": "This is a fictional representation of healthcare data intended for interoperability testing and solution development. The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 30-year-old Hispanic female presents with acute hepatitis C likely acquired during recent travel to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where she engaged in beach activities, snorkeling, sightseeing, and dining out from May 15 to May 22, 2024. Prior to that, she was in Colorado Springs, CO, from April 1 to June 30, 2024, carrying out normal daily activities around home and work. She developed symptoms including fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Diagnostic tests on June 10 confirmed HCV infection during an outpatient consultation and diagnostic procedure. Treatment with direct-acting antivirals was initiated on June 12, followed by a therapeutic procedure, and her condition was monitored during a follow-up consultation on June 20, 2024. With good response to treatment, a full recovery is expected."
