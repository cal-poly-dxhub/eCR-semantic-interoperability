        "Past Medical History": "Patient reports no significant past medical history. He immigrated from Vietnam 5 years ago and has had limited access to healthcare. He denies any known chronic conditions or previous hospitalizations. Patient reports receiving some childhood vaccinations in Vietnam but is unsure of specifics. No known allergies. Patient is a current smoker, 1/2 pack per day for 10 years.",

        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Nguyen is a 32-year-old Vietnamese male who presents with a 3-week history of progressive fatigue, loss of appetite, and recent onset of jaundice. The patient reports that his symptoms began insidiously about 3 weeks ago with general fatigue and weakness. Over the past 2 weeks, he noticed a significant decrease in appetite and has lost approximately 5 kg. One week ago, he observed yellowing of his skin and eyes, which prompted him to seek medical attention.\n\nThe patient also reports mild right upper quadrant abdominal discomfort and nausea, but denies vomiting or fever. He has noticed his urine becoming darker over the past few days. He denies any recent alcohol consumption or use of new medications or supplements.\n\nOf note, the patient recently traveled to Vietnam from May 1-15, 2024, where he stayed with family, attended a wedding, and received a traditional massage. He also reports attending a crowded social gathering in Baltimore in March where he shared food and drinks with others.\n\nThe patient works as a part-time server in a restaurant and is a current smoker. He has no known chronic medical conditions and is not on any regular medications. He is unsure about his vaccination history, particularly regarding hepatitis B.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Diagnosis: Based on the patient's presentation and risk factors, we suspect acute hepatitis B infection. We will proceed with the following diagnostic tests:\n   - Complete blood count (CBC)\n   - Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)\n   - Prothrombin time (PT) and INR\n   - Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)\n   - Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) IgM\n   - Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)\n   - Hepatitis B viral load (HBV DNA)\n   - Liver ultrasound\n\n2. Management:\n   - Patient education on hepatitis B transmission, prognosis, and self-care measures\n   - Advise rest and adequate hydration\n   - Recommend abstinence from alcohol and potentially hepatotoxic medications\n   - Provide dietary advice to manage nausea and maintain nutrition\n\n3. Follow-up:\n   - Schedule follow-up appointment in 1 week to review test results\n   - Arrange for testing of close contacts and sexual partners\n   - Consider referral to hepatologist for further management if acute hepatitis B is confirmed\n\n4. Supportive care:\n   - Prescribe antiemetic (ondansetron 4mg PO q8h PRN) for nausea\n   - Recommend acetaminophen 500mg PO q6h PRN for pain, not to exceed 2g/day\n\n5. Public health measures:\n   - Report suspected case to local health department\n   - Counsel on preventing transmission to others\n\n6. Long-term considerations:\n   - Discuss hepatitis A and B vaccination if not previously immunized\n   - Address smoking cessation strategies\n\n7. Monitor for signs of acute liver failure and be prepared for potential hospitalization if condition worsens.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient is unsure about his hepatitis B vaccination status. He recalls receiving some childhood vaccinations in Vietnam but cannot provide specific details. No documentation of hepatitis B vaccination is available. Given the uncertainty, we will proceed with serological testing to determine his hepatitis B status and immunity."
