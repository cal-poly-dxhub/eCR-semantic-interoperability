        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Denies fatigue, fever, or chills except as noted in HPI. HEENT: Denies headaches, vision changes, sore throat, oral lesions. Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, wheezing. Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations. Gastrointestinal: Severe abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea as noted in HPI. Genitourinary: Denies dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency. Musculoskeletal: Denies muscle aches, joint pains, back pain. Skin: Denies rashes, lesions. Neurological: Denies dizziness, weakness, numbness, tingling. Psychiatric: Denies depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances.",
        "History of Present Illness": "This is a 32-year-old previously healthy female who presents with a 2-day history of severe abdominal cramps and diarrhea. She reports recently returning from a vacation in Panama City Beach on 06/22/2024 where she stayed at a beach resort and participated in typical vacation activities such as dining out and shopping. Her symptoms began on 06/23/2024 with severe cramping abdominal pain and frequent watery diarrhea. She denies any recent sick contacts, food poisoning, or ingestion of undercooked meats/eggs. The following day (06/24/2024) she developed nausea, vomiting, low-grade fever, and headache prompting her to come to the emergency department. She denies any recent antibiotic use or travel outside the local area other than the aforementioned beach vacation.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "This 32-year-old female presents with an acute gastroenteritis most consistent with salmonella food poisoning likely acquired during her recent beach vacation. She is hemodynamically stable but appears dehydrated. The plan is to admit for IV fluid hydration, anti-emetics, and symptomatic treatment. Stool cultures and CBC will be obtained. If cultures confirm salmonella, she may require outpatient antibiotic treatment upon discharge. Expect symptoms to improve over the next 2-3 days with supportive care. Follow-up scheduled in 4 days. Prognosis is good for full recovery without complications given her young age and lack of comorbidities.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient states she received the routine childhood vaccinations but is unsure if she has received any vaccines against salmonella or other foodborne illnesses as an adult."
