Patient Education: Thoroughly explain the nature of chronic hepatitis B, its potential long-term effects, and the importance of ongoing monitoring and treatment. Discuss modes of transmission and necessary precautions to prevent spread to others. 3. Antiviral Therapy: Initiate treatment with entecavir 0.5 mg orally once daily. Explain the importance of adherence to medication regimen. 4. Laboratory Monitoring: Schedule follow-up labs in 4 weeks to assess HBV DNA levels, liver function tests, and complete blood count. Plan for regular monitoring every 3-6 months thereafter. 5. Imaging: Schedule a follow-up abdominal ultrasound in 6 months to monitor for any changes in liver appearance. 6. Lifestyle Modifications: Advise complete abstinence from alcohol. Encourage a balanced, healthy diet and regular exercise. 7. Vaccination: Recommend hepatitis A vaccination if not previously immunized. 8. Partner Screening: Advise screening of sexual partners and close household contacts for hepatitis B. Recommend vaccination for those who are not immune. 9. Specialist Referral: Refer to a hepatologist for ongoing co-management. 10. Follow-up: Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to review lab results and assess response to treatment. 11. Support Resources: Provide information on support groups and additional educational resources for patients with chronic hepatitis B.",
