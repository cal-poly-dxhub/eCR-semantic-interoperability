Negative for dizziness, syncope, or focal weakness. Psychiatric: Negative for depression or anxiety. All other systems reviewed and negative.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 55-year-old African American male who presents with a 3-day history of cough, fever, body aches, and malaise. He reports that his cough started on June 15th, 2024, and was initially dry but has become more productive with yellow-green sputum. He developed a fever of 101\u00b0F on June 16th, along with generalized body aches and fatigue. He also noticed a mild headache starting yesterday. He denies any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or difficulty breathing. He has not had any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.

        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's presentation of cough, fever, body aches, and malaise, along with his recent travel history, the most likely diagnosis is mild COVID-19 infection. The plan is as follows: 1) Obtain a rapid COVID-19 antigen test and confirmatory PCR test if the antigen test is positive. 2) Prescribe symptomatic treatment with acetaminophen for fever and body aches, and an over-the-counter cough suppressant as needed. 3) Advise the patient to self-isolate at home for at least 5 days from symptom onset and until fever-free for 24 hours without antipyretics. 4) Recommend increased fluid intake and rest. 5) Provide instructions on monitoring for worsening symptoms that may require hospitalization. 6) Schedule a follow-up visit or telehealth visit in 5-7 days to reassess. 7) Discuss COVID-19 vaccination status and recommend vaccination if not up-to-date.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports being fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, having received two doses in March and April of 2021. However, he has not yet received any booster doses."
