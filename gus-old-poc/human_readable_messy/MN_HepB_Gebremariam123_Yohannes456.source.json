Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, normal heart sounds. Gastrointestinal: Mild epigastric tenderness, no rebound or guarding. Genitourinary: No complaints. Musculoskeletal: No complaints. Skin: Jaundiced appearance. Neurological: Alert and oriented x3. Psychiatric: Mood and affect appropriate.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 36-year-old Ethiopian male who presented with a 2-week history of fatigue, abdominal discomfort, nausea, loss of appetite, and dark urine. He recently returned from a trip to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he visited family and attended a wedding from May 15th to June 22nd, 2023. Upon returning to Minneapolis on June 23rd, he began experiencing the aforementioned symptoms. Over the past few days, he has also noticed yellowing of his skin and eyes. He denies any fever, chills, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. He has no known sick contacts or recent illnesses. His last hepatitis B vaccination was over 10 years ago.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's clinical presentation, travel history, and laboratory findings, the diagnosis is chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with HBeAg positivity. This indicates active viral replication and a high risk of progression to advanced liver disease. The plan is to initiate antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg once daily. Baseline labs will be ordered, including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, hepatitis B viral load, and hepatitis B e-antigen. The patient will be counseled on the importance of medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up. He will be referred to a hepatologist for further management and monitoring. Vaccination against hepatitis A virus will also be recommended.",
