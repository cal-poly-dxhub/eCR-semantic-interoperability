In September 2023, she traveled within the Northern Mariana Islands to the island of Saipan for routine purposes, visiting family and running errands. She used personal vehicle transportation during this domestic trip. In March 2023, the patient took an international vacation to Guam, staying at the Dusit Thani Guam Resort. She traveled by commercial airline and engaged in sightseeing activities such as visiting beaches and cultural tours during her stay in Guam. Both of these trips occurred prior to the patient's reported COVID-19 illness, and the travel to Guam, which involved air travel and tourist activities, may have increased her risk of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.",

        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 65-year-old Chinese female who contracted COVID-19 in June 2023. She initially experienced typical symptoms of fever, cough, and body aches for approximately 10 days. After recovering from the acute phase, she has been experiencing persistent fatigue, brain fog, and joint pain for the past 6 months. The fatigue is described as moderate in severity, with periods of feeling exhausted and lacking energy despite adequate rest. The brain fog manifests as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and a general feeling of mental cloudiness. The joint pain is diffuse, affecting multiple joints including the knees, hips, shoulders, and hands. It is described as a dull, aching pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest. The patient denies any recent illnesses, injuries, or changes in medication. She has tried over-the-counter pain medications with minimal relief.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Order laboratory tests including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR) to evaluate for potential underlying causes or complications. 2. Obtain chest X-ray to rule out any residual lung involvement from COVID-19. 3. Refer to physical therapy for evaluation and management of joint pain and muscle weakness. 4. Consider cognitive behavioral therapy or referral to a neuropsychologist for management of brain fog and cognitive impairment. 5. Recommend lifestyle modifications including regular exercise, stress management techniques, and a balanced diet. 6. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 4 weeks to reassess symptoms and review test results.",
