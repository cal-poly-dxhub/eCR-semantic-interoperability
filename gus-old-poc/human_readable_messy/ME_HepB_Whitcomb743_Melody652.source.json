        "Reason for Visit": "Follow-up for chronic hepatitis B and evaluation of mild fatigue and abdominal discomfort",
        "Past Medical History": "Patient was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B in 2018 following routine screening. Liver biopsy in 2019 showed mild fibrosis (F1 on METAVIR scale). No history of hepatic decompensation. Past medical history also includes mild depression (diagnosed 2020, well-controlled with sertraline) and seasonal allergies. Surgical history includes appendectomy (2005) and wisdom teeth extraction (2003). Patient quit smoking in 2015 after a 5-pack-year history. No history of alcohol abuse or intravenous drug use. Family history notable for maternal aunt with breast cancer.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Reports mild fatigue, denies fever, chills, or significant weight changes. HEENT: No visual changes, hearing loss, sinus problems, or oral lesions. Cardiovascular: Denies chest pain, palpitations, or edema. Respiratory: No shortness of breath, cough, or wheezing. Gastrointestinal: Reports mild, intermittent right upper quadrant discomfort, occasional nausea, and slightly decreased appetite. Denies vomiting, changes in bowel habits, or blood in stool. Genitourinary: No dysuria, urgency, or changes in urine color. Musculoskeletal: Mild joint pain, particularly in knees and hands. No muscle weakness. Skin: No rashes, jaundice, or pruritus. Neurological: No headaches, dizziness, or changes in sensation. Psychiatric: Mood stable on current medication, no sleep disturbances.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Whitcomb is a 38-year-old female with a history of chronic hepatitis B, diagnosed in 2018 during routine screening. She has been maintained on entecavir 0.5 mg daily since diagnosis with good virologic suppression. Today, she presents for her scheduled 6-month follow-up and reports new onset of mild fatigue over the past 3-4 weeks. She also notes intermittent right upper quadrant discomfort for the past week, described as a dull ache, rated 2/10 in severity. Patient reports mild decrease in appetite but denies nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. She denies fever, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss. No recent travel or changes in medications. She continues to abstain from alcohol and has not used any new supplements or over-the-counter medications. Patient has been adherent to her antiviral medication regimen and hasn't missed any doses.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Continue entecavir 0.5 mg daily for chronic hepatitis B. 2. Order comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and hepatitis B viral load to assess current liver function and viral suppression. 3. Schedule right upper quadrant ultrasound to evaluate for any changes in liver appearance or development of focal lesions. 4. Recommend avoidance of alcohol and hepatotoxic medications. 5. Encourage a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Suggest moderate exercise as tolerated to help with fatigue. 6. Provide patient education on signs and symptoms that should prompt earlier follow-up (e.g., worsening abdominal pain, jaundice, severe fatigue). 7. Schedule follow-up appointment in 3 months to review test results and reassess symptoms. 8. Consider referral to rheumatology if joint pain persists or worsens, to evaluate for possible extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HBV or other underlying conditions. 9. Continue to monitor for any signs of hepatocellular carcinoma as per guidelines for chronic HBV patients. 10. Reinforce importance of medication adherence and regular follow-ups for optimal management of chronic hepatitis B.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient reports receiving hepatitis A vaccine series in 2018 after chronic hepatitis B diagnosis. Unsure about hepatitis B vaccination status in childhood. Has received annual influenza vaccines, most recent in October 2023. COVID-19 vaccination series completed in 2021 with booster in 2022. Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis (Tdap) booster received in 2019. Patient agrees to review and update any missing vaccinations as recommended."
