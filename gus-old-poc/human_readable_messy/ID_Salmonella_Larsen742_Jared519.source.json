        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Larsen is a 47-year-old male presenting with a 3-day history of severe diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Symptoms began abruptly on the evening of June 29, 2024, approximately 9 days after attending a community potluck where he consumed various homemade dishes, including a potato salad that he recalls tasting 'slightly off'. He reports having >10 watery, non-bloody stools per day, accompanied by nausea and intermittent vomiting. The patient describes diffuse abdominal pain, crampy in nature, rated 6/10 in severity.

Mr. Larsen has been attempting to stay hydrated with water and sports drinks but reports feeling increasingly weak and dizzy. He denies any similar symptoms in family members or close contacts. Of note, the patient traveled to Boise for a conference from June 24-26, where he ate at various restaurants and food trucks, and to Missoula from June 15-17, where he attended a backyard barbecue. He sought medical attention due to worsening symptoms and inability to maintain adequate hydration at home.",

Initiate IV fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution, 1L bolus followed by maintenance fluids. 3. Obtain stool culture and sensitivity to confirm Salmonella infection and guide antibiotic therapy if needed. 4. Start empiric antibiotic therapy with Ciprofloxacin 500mg IV q12h, pending culture results. 5. Administer ondansetron 4mg IV q6h as needed for nausea and vomiting. 6. Provide oral rehydration solution once vomiting is controlled. 7. Monitor electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine daily. 8. Gradual advancement of diet as tolerated, starting with clear liquids. 9. Encourage frequent hand washing and implement contact precautions to prevent spread. 10. Consult Infectious Disease and Gastroenterology services for further management recommendations. 11. Educate patient on food safety practices and the importance of proper hygiene. 12. Plan for discharge when able to tolerate oral intake, maintain hydration, and symptoms are improving. 13. Notify local health department of confirmed Salmonella case for potential outbreak investigation.",
