Given the incubation period and symptom onset timeline for salmonella infection, the potluck picnic and possible exposure to contaminated food or surfaces emerges as the most likely source of his recent illness."

        "Past Medical History": "Mr. Jackson is a 45-year-old African American male with a past medical history of hypertension, well-controlled with lisinopril. He has no known drug allergies. He is a former smoker, having quit 5 years ago after smoking for 10 years. He denies any history of gastrointestinal issues or similar symptoms in the past.",
        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Denies fever, chills, or unintentional weight changes. HEENT: Denies headaches, vision changes, sore throat, or ear pain. Respiratory: Denies cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Cardiovascular: Denies palpitations, edema, or chest pain. Gastrointestinal: Severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Genitourinary: Denies dysuria, hematuria, or urinary frequency. Musculoskeletal: Denies joint pain or swelling. Neurological: Denies dizziness, weakness, or numbness. Psychiatric: Denies anxiety or depression.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Mr. Jackson presents with a 2-day history of severe abdominal cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms started abruptly on the morning of June 16th, with severe cramping abdominal pain and watery diarrhea. He reports having 10-12 episodes of diarrhea per day, along with nausea and occasional vomiting. He denies any recent travel, but did attend a neighborhood potluck picnic on June 15th, where he consumed various foods brought by neighbors. He denies any recent antibiotic use or exposure to anyone else with similar symptoms. His symptoms have persisted, and he now reports a low-grade fever, headache, and muscle cramps in addition to the gastrointestinal symptoms.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the history and presentation, Mr. Jackson likely has a case of salmonella gastroenteritis, possibly acquired from contaminated food at the potluck picnic. The plan is to admit him for supportive care with intravenous fluids and antiemetics to manage dehydration and symptoms. Stool cultures and bloodwork will be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any complications. He will be started on ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID for treatment of the salmonella infection. Strict hand hygiene and contact precautions will be implemented during his hospital stay. He will be monitored closely for any signs of worsening or complications, with the expectation that his condition should improve within 3-5 days with appropriate treatment. Upon discharge, he will be instructed on dietary modifications and hygiene measures to prevent transmission.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Mr. Jackson reports being up-to-date on all recommended vaccinations, including the typhoid vaccine he received 5 years ago prior to a trip abroad. However, he has not received any recent vaccinations against salmonella or other foodborne illnesses."

A 45-year-old African American male presented with severe gastroenteritis symptoms likely caused by salmonella poisoning from a contaminated food source at a neighborhood potluck.
