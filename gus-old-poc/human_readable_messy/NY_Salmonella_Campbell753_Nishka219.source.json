        "Summary": "This is a fictional representation of healthcare data intended for interoperability testing and solution development. The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 28-year-old pregnant woman (12 weeks gestation) presented to the ED with severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. Symptoms began 3 days prior, following recent travel to Jamaica. Stool culture confirmed Salmonella infection. The patient was admitted for IV fluids, antiemetics, and antibiotics. Complications included dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Fetal well-being was monitored via ultrasound. The patient showed gradual improvement with treatment, but ongoing issues were anticipated. Follow-up was scheduled with OB/GYN post-discharge."
