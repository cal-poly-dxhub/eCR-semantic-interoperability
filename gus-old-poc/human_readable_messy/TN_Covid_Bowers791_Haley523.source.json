The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 26-year-old female teacher presented with cough, fever, and body aches starting July 1, 2024. She had recent travel history to Nashville and Knoxville. On July 3, 2024, she visited an outpatient clinic where several evaluations were performed, including an outpatient visit, initial evaluation, respiratory assessment, fever assessment, and COVID-19 screening. COVID-19 was suspected, and rapid antigen and PCR tests were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patient was diagnosed with early-stage, symptomatic COVID-19. Treatment included over-the-counter medications for symptom relief. She was instructed to self-isolate and monitor symptoms. The patient had no prior COVID-19 vaccinations and was open to discussing vaccination after recovery."
