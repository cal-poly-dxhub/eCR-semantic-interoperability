On July 8-9, 2024, she attended a business conference in Philadelphia, eating at the hotel restaurant and a local deli. On July 6, 2024, she participated in a community potluck in Doylestown, consuming various homemade dishes. This event, involving multiple food sources prepared by different individuals, presents a potential risk for foodborne illness. Earlier, from June 28 to July 1, 2024, the patient visited New York City, where she dined at several restaurants and attended a street food festival in Brooklyn. The street food festival, in particular, could be a possible source of exposure to improperly handled or undercooked food. These recent travel activities, especially those involving communal meals and street food, warrant consideration in the context of the patient's salmonella infection."

No known allergies to medications. Up-to-date on routine vaccinations. No history of international travel to areas with high risk of foodborne illnesses.",
        "Review of Systems": "General: Reports fatigue and weakness. Denies recent weight loss.\nGastrointestinal: Complains of severe watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and nausea. Has experienced multiple episodes of vomiting. Denies blood in stool.\nCardiovascular: Denies chest pain or palpitations. No history of heart disease.\nRespiratory: Breathing normally. No cough or shortness of breath.\nNeurological: Reports mild headache. No dizziness or loss of consciousness.\nMusculoskeletal: General body aches noted.

        "History of Present Illness": "Emily Keller, a 32-year-old female, presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of severe diarrhea and abdominal pain that started two days ago on July 7, 2024. The diarrhea is described as watery and frequent, occurring up to 8-10 times per day. She reports moderate to severe abdominal cramping, primarily in the lower abdomen. The patient developed a fever (measured at home as 38.3\u00b0C) and nausea on July 8, with occasional vomiting starting the same day. She also complains of fatigue, headache, and general body aches.\n\nThe patient recalls attending a community potluck in Doylestown on July 6, where she consumed various homemade dishes. She also reports recent business travel to Philadelphia on July 8-9, during which she ate at a hotel restaurant and a local deli. Prior to these events, she had visited New York City from June 28 to July 1, including attendance at a street food festival in Brooklyn.\n\nThe patient has attempted to stay hydrated but is concerned about dehydration due to the persistent diarrhea and vomiting. She denies any blood in her stool or recent antibiotic use. No other family members or close contacts have reported similar symptoms. The patient decided to seek medical attention due to the severity and persistence of her symptoms, as well as her inability to maintain adequate hydration at home.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Diagnosis: Based on the patient's symptoms and recent history, we suspect salmonella poisoning. Will order stool culture and blood tests to confirm diagnosis.\n\n2. Hydration: Initiate IV fluid replacement with lactated Ringer's solution to address dehydration. Monitor fluid intake and output.\n\n3. Symptom Management:\n   a. Administer ondansetron 4mg IV for nausea and vomiting\n   b. Prescribe loperamide 4mg initially, then 2mg after each loose stool (not to exceed 16mg/day) for diarrhea control\n   c. Acetaminophen 650mg PO q6h for fever and pain management\n\n4. Antibiotics: Hold on antibiotic treatment pending culture results and assessment of severity. Consider ciprofloxacin if severe symptoms persist or patient is at high risk for complications.\n\n5. Diet: Recommend BRAT diet (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, Toast) as tolerated, with gradual introduction of other foods. Emphasize importance of fluid intake.\n\n6. Monitoring: Closely monitor vital signs, especially for signs of worsening dehydration or electrolyte imbalances.\n\n7. Patient Education: Provide information on food safety practices and the importance of proper handwashing to prevent spread.\n\n8. Follow-up: Schedule follow-up appointment in 2-3 days to review culture results and assess symptom improvement. Instruct patient to return immediately if symptoms worsen or signs of dehydration develop.\n\n9. Reporting: Report suspected case of salmonella poisoning to local health department as per regulations.\n\n10. Occupational Considerations: Provide work excuse note for at least 3 days, with the possibility of extension based on symptom resolution and follow-up assessment.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "Patient reports being up-to-date on all routine vaccinations, including annual flu shots. However, she is unsure about her typhoid vaccination status, which could be relevant given the suspected salmonella infection. Patient agrees to review her vaccination records and provide updates at the follow-up appointment."
