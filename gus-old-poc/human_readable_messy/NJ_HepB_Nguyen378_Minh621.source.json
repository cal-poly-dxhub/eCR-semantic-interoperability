Over the past 2 weeks, she has also experienced abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, nausea, loss of appetite, and noticed her urine has become darker in color. She denies any fever, chills, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. She also reports noticing yellowing of her skin and eyes over the past few days. She has no history of liver disease or other chronic medical conditions. She is a former smoker but quit 5 years ago. She denies any alcohol or drug use. Her family history is unremarkable.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the clinical presentation and initial laboratory findings, the patient has been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B with compensated cirrhosis. The plan is to start her on antiviral therapy with tenofovir 300 mg once daily. She will need regular monitoring with liver function tests, hepatitis B viral load, and imaging studies to assess for disease progression or complications. Lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet, exercise, and avoidance of alcohol, will be recommended. She should also receive hepatitis A and pneumococcal vaccinations. Close follow-up will be arranged in 4 weeks to assess response to treatment and adjust management as needed. With appropriate treatment and monitoring, the prognosis is good for long-term management of her condition.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient reports receiving the hepatitis B vaccine series as a child but is unsure of the specific dates. She has not received the hepatitis A or pneumococcal vaccines."
