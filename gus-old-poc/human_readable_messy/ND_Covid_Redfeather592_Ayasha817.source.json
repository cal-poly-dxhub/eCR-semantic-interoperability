Obesity (BMI 32.4). Former smoker, quit 2 years ago with 15 pack-year history. No known history of respiratory diseases or immunocompromising conditions.",

Gastrointestinal: Positive for decreased appetite, negative for nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Musculoskeletal: Positive for generalized body aches. Neurological: Negative for headache, dizziness, or altered mental status. Skin: Negative for rashes or lesions. Patient denies any recent travel outside of North Dakota or known COVID-19 exposure.",
        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Redfeather is a 50-year-old Native American female who presented to the emergency department with severe shortness of breath and fever. Symptoms began 3 days ago with a dry cough and low-grade fever. Over the past 48 hours, she developed progressively worsening dyspnea, high fever (up to 39.5\u00b0C at home), and severe fatigue. She reports attending a local powwow 5 days ago and working at the casino until 2 days ago when she became too ill to work. She denies any known direct contact with COVID-19 positive individuals but acknowledges possible exposure due to her work in a public-facing role. Patient attempted to manage symptoms at home with over-the-counter antipyretics and rest but sought emergency care when she became severely short of breath, even at rest. On presentation, she was hypoxic with an SpO2 of 82% on room air, tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 32, and febrile at 39.2\u00b0C.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "1. Admit to ICU for management of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. 2. Initiate mechanical ventilation with lung-protective strategy (low tidal volumes, PEEP titration). 3. Start IV Remdesivir 200 mg loading dose, followed by 100 mg daily for 5 days. 4. Administer IV Dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days. 5. Initiate empiric antibiotic coverage with IV Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin pending culture results. 6. Implement prone positioning protocol as tolerated. 7. Initiate DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous Enoxaparin. 8. Maintain euglycemia with insulin sliding scale. 9. Continue home medications for hypertension and diabetes. 10. Provide supportive care including fluid management, nutrition, and prevention of complications. 11. Monitor for cytokine storm and consider Tocilizumab if rapid deterioration occurs. 12. Consult Infectious Disease for ongoing management. 13. Arrange for daily multidisciplinary rounds to reassess treatment plan and progress.",

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 50-year-old Native American female with diabetes and hypertension developed severe COVID-19 after attending a local powwow. She presented with dyspnea, fever, and hypoxemia on June 15, 2024. Rapidly progressing to respiratory failure, she was intubated and admitted to the ICU at Sanford Medical Center in Bismarck. Treatment included mechanical ventilation, Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, and supportive care. By June 30, her condition was critical but stable, requiring ongoing intensive care."
