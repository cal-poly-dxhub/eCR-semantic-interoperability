        "Review of Systems": "Constitutional: Positive for fatigue and loss of appetite. Negative for fever, chills, or weight changes. HEENT: Negative for headaches, vision changes, sore throat, or ear pain. Respiratory: Negative for cough, shortness of breath, or wheezing. Cardiovascular: Negative for chest pain, palpitations, or edema. Gastrointestinal: Positive for nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Negative for diarrhea, constipation, or melena.

Psychiatric: Negative for depression, anxiety, or sleep disturbances. Endocrine: Negative for heat or cold intolerance. Hematologic: Negative for easy bruising or bleeding. Allergic/Immunologic: Negative for rashes or environmental allergies.",
        "History of Present Illness": "The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a 5-day history of fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain. He initially noticed feeling more tired than usual and a decreased appetite around May 20th. Over the next few days, he developed nausea and occasional vomiting, as well as a dull, aching pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen. On May 24th, he noticed that the whites of his eyes and his skin had developed a yellowish tint, consistent with jaundice. He denies any recent travel outside of a vacation to Las Vegas from May 12-18, where he stayed at the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino. He reports no high-risk sexual behavior or intravenous drug use. His last alcoholic drink was on May 18th, during his vacation. He has not started any new medications or supplements recently.",
        "Plan of Treatment": "Based on the patient's presentation of fatigue, nausea, jaundice, and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, the leading diagnosis is acute hepatitis B infection. The plan is to order serologic testing for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and hepatitis B surface antibody to confirm the diagnosis. We will also obtain a complete metabolic panel to evaluate liver function tests. If hepatitis B is confirmed, the patient will be referred to a hepatologist for monitoring and potential treatment with antivirals if indicated. Symptomatic treatment with anti-nausea medications and hydration will be provided. The patient should avoid alcohol and acetaminophen products during this time. He will be advised on preventive measures to avoid transmitting the infection to others. With appropriate management, the prognosis is good for full recovery from this acute hepatitis B infection.",
        "Vaccine Credential Patient Assertion": "The patient states he has received the hepatitis B vaccine series in the past but does not have documentation readily available."
