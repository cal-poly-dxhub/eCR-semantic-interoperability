        "History of Present Illness": "Ms. Brantley is a 25-year-old female who presents with complaints of fatigue and mild abdominal discomfort that have been present for the past few weeks. The fatigue began gradually about 3 weeks ago and has slowly worsened, affecting her daily activities and work performance. She describes feeling constantly tired, even after a full night's sleep.\n\nThe abdominal discomfort started about 2 weeks ago and is localized primarily to the right upper quadrant. It is described as a dull ache, intermittent in nature, and mild in intensity. The pain is not associated with food intake and does not radiate.\n\nShe also notes a mild decrease in appetite over the past week but denies any significant weight loss. She reports occasional nausea but no vomiting. No changes in bowel habits or urination.\n\nOf note, the patient received a tattoo at a local parlor in Charlotte approximately 3 months ago. She denies any history of intravenous drug use, blood transfusions, or known exposure to individuals with hepatitis C.\n\nShe has not taken any over-the-counter medications for her symptoms.

Advise patient to avoid alcohol consumption while awaiting test results.\n6. Schedule follow-up appointment in one week to review test results.\n7. If hepatitis C is confirmed, refer patient to hepatology for further evaluation and treatment planning.\n8. Consider ultrasound of the liver if liver function tests are abnormal.\n9. Provide supportive care for symptoms: recommend adequate rest and hydration for fatigue.\n10. Advise patient to return sooner if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.\n11. Discuss importance of notifying recent close contacts and sexual partners if diagnosis is confirmed.",

The data are entirely fictitious and do not represent a real person or a real clinical scenario. A 25-year-old female presents with fatigue and mild abdominal discomfort. She received a tattoo 3 months prior. Initial tests reveal positive hepatitis C antibodies and elevated liver enzymes. Diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C is made, with viral load of 5.8 log IU/mL. Patient experiences mild symptoms including fatigue, right upper quadrant pain, and decreased appetite. Treatment plan includes direct-acting antivirals (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) scheduled to start in two weeks, with additional diagnostic procedures planned to assess liver health."
