The patient has also experienced nausea and vomiting for the past 2 days, with difficulty keeping food or liquids down.

She denies any urinary symptoms, vaginal bleeding, or contractions. Of note, the patient traveled to Jamaica 3 weeks ago for a family reunion, where she attended a large barbecue and ate at local restaurants.

The patient is concerned about the impact of her symptoms on her pregnancy and has not experienced relief with over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications.",
